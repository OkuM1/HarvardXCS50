Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The smaller N the less time it would need.
10 simulations take more time than 100.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: i think 10000 are good enough

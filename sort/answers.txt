sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes the least amount of time sorting the already sorted file. Since Ω(n) is the fastest in that case.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: When comparing the sorting time of the randomized list it is the fastest. By comparison O(n log(n)) is the fastest algorithm here.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Takes the longest amount of time sorting the already sorted list. Best case is still takes Ω(n^2) compared to the others.

According to Spotify "Audrio Aura" is a metric calculated by measuring the "energy" of an audio track.
By assigning the two best fitting audio "moods" taken from the colors matching the energy metrics they represent your wrapped year with a final color gradient visualization.
I would take the avg energy, avg danceability and avg valence as metrics to calculate the aura.
Since these values are very subjective they represent good indicators to visualize something as abstract as an aura.
Maybe multiplying these would give us a number that we could fit in a range of colors and pick the best mood for the listener.
Higher energy means could be correlated to purple and lower energy more towards green.
Higher or lower Valence could decide between yellow and blue.
By contrasting two colors we can assume a lower or higher value with a cutoff-point to lean towards one or the other.


However since the calculation is limited to 100 songs it is very superficial representation of their taste and as such their "aura".
One might also interpret a song that is regarded as a party or "dance song" in a more melodramatic way so our data makes assumptions that
take a certain consensus for granted across all listeners.

I would take a much larger set of songs and categorize them by genres. Then we can give each genre a corresponding color or multiple colors.
By counting up the points of each color according to every single song and the genre in their respective colors we might able to more accurately represent
the aura of the listener. This would require an extensive list of every genre and a subjective categorization of those in every color but might increase
accuracy due to the amount of data take into account.
